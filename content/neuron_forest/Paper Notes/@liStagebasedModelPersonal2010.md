# Old Zotero Notes:

**RQ**: What problems do people have in using PI systems? And how can they be designed to overcome these challenges?

**Key Finding**: Creation of a "stage" model of personal informatics, including a presentation of barriers at each stage.

These barriers can "cascade" into future stages.

1. Preparation - deciding which tools to use, how one will track, etc.

2. Collection - active data collection

3. Integration - stage between collection and reflection. Whatever compiling/viz is necessary to start reflection.

4. Reflection - Looking at information and reflecting. No detail given! Table of barriers to reflection is interesting.

5. Action - some sort of behavior change

Properties of the stages:

1. Barriers can cascade into later stages

2. Stages are iterative - tool changes, for example

3. System vs. user driven - responsibilities for each stage can be user, system, or both (driven). Such as having the system automatically collect the data

4. Multi vs uni faceted - how many aspects of a users life are being tracked?

**Notable Methods Used**: Survey. Recruited participants from website like quantified self and blogs. Those surveyed had clear existing interest in self-tracking.

**Further Reading**: Good general lists of PI systems. Ben Franklin might have been the first! (cited his autobiography)

**General notes and ideas from the readings**:

-The relationship with time is most interesting.  It seems the common theme is to collect data *in the present* in order to, at some point in the future, reflect on that data (which is now historical data). What do tools look like that gather data "in the moment" for "in the moment reflection" ?

- "As noted, some people stumble upon tools, which drive them to start collecting." this is an 'if you build it they will come' philosophy of adoption. This is highly intriguing. When the existence of the system itself becomes the causal factor in deciding to learn about oneself.

**Discussion points for class:**

-How useful is the stage based model to designing PI systems?  At first glance, PI systems completely handle the integration stage.  Do we really use PI systems in stage? Or are we sort of always in every stage? IE, reflecting can happen at time of tracking, simply through the act of noticing.
