A resonant finding with [[@easterlinDoesEconomicGrowth1974]] is that of "life circumstances have surprisingly little influence on the global reports of life satisfaction."  Life circumstances are often summarized by economists and policymakers as [[income per capita]], aggregated as [[GDP]]. 

"Real differences in enjoyment are not reflected in satisfaction."  If it takes more enjoyment to reach the same level of satisfaction. 

This paper also compared lived experience affect with global reports of life satisfaction. 

They found "circumstances often have more impact on life satisfaction than on affective experience, in accord with the focusing hypothesis."
