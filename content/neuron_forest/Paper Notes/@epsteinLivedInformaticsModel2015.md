# Old Zotero Notes
**RQ**: What model of personal informatics accurately reflects the lived experience involved in PI?

**Key Finding**: A new model of PI that involves different actions that can occur outside of the traditional 5 stage model.

The model is expanded to include reasons for tracking other than for behavior change (which was assumed in the earlier stage model).

Systems should be able to handle the lapse in tracking that so often occurs, and decide how to handle it in the system. Different types of lapses are defined (forgetting, upkeep, skipping, and suspending).

Instrumental tracking goals are when the user tracks something, but not for behavior change. Instead they do it to have a log of the behavior.

  
The reasons for tracking inform the process by which the user obtains a tracking device/system.

**Notable Methods Used**: MTurk survey.. of MTurkers

**Further Reading**:

**General notes and ideas from the readings**:

35% of purchased assistive technologies are not adopted!

**Discussion points for class:**

- Is there a review paper that paints a vision for the field of PI?

- What might interoperability between different PI systems look like?
