Described well in https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27069 as "An adaptive preference results when we **bend aspiration towards expectation in light of experience**. We come to want what we think is within our grasp."

This can result in use de-valuing things we don't think we can get, and start to value things we think we can get more. 

From [[@kahnemanSurveyMethodCharacterizing2004]] we learn that if changes are recent, they come to mind more often, and therefore are more salient in self-evaluations. A divorce is most salient immediately after the divorce, and then life starts to revert back to normal.
