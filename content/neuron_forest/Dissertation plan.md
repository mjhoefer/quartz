The idea is that structured reflection...

Use a theory of the self, one of many, any way of representing the self in a "parts of" form.

And the "parts of"

Building a theory agnostic tool for facilitating experiments that involve representing the self as a network. 

There are many ways this could be used.

I want to build a kind of tool that has a purpose, but there's a different between the actual tool and the use of the tool.

I'm conflating the two...

I want to build a tool, a interface that enables this representation of the self.

So the data can come from multiple places.

But at the core, we have a tool that enables a user to construct a network version of their self, however they want.

And we have a way for them to bring in personal event data.


The bit of personal informatics should be a single AMR.

Personal informatics systems can store AMRs in different ways... give each data output an AMR representation.

For every main PI system, grab the data export, and create AMRs for all the different kinds of data. What do you get by putting them together?

Look for similarities across the AMR structure to find classes of personal informatics information. 


Make a tool for researchers


A Tool for general representations of the self

Just a tool that lets you turn yourself into a collection of nodes, and structure data about yourself with respect to those nodes.

You choose the edges, you choose the nodes.

You can participate in experiments that help to advance the understanding of the self as a complex system.

Self complexity. 

If representing an individual in parts is part of your theory or practice. 





So in most AMRs, the individual is a single node. 

What happens when you have AMRs for distributed individuals. 

Individual as network. 

We unintentionally reify ourselves as individible units. Biology says otherwise, psychology says otherwise. Humans are #moreThanNodes. They are entire networks.
