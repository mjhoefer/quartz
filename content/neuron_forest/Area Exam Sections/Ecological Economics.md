The field of ecological economics deals with the intersection of human economic activity and the ecological systems (environments) that support that activity. Ecological economics has also been called *systems economics* due to it's system-level view of human society and the ecosystems that support human society [[@hagensEconomicsFutureSuperorganism2020a]]. 

Hagen's offers a conceptual view of human society as consisting of a single *superorganism* that exhibits goal-seeking behavior of it's own accord [[@hagensEconomicsFutureSuperorganism2020a]]. The behavior of the superorganism is emergent, and specifically emerges from the aggregated behavioral patterns of all its constituent individual humans. In another [essay](https://fleeingvesuvius.org/2011/05/10/the-psychological-roots-of-resource-overconsumption/), Hagens argues that two fundamental drivers of human activity lead to overconsumption from a demand side. 

1. Humans use consumption (fast cars, expensive vacations, etc) as a **status symbol** with which social hierarchies can be constructed. Human seek out "[[Veblen Goods]]" which have increasing demand as price goes up. 
2. **Humans seek novelty**, as part of the "[[mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway]]." We focus our attention on novel stimuli because of an evolutionary drive to notice and understand new things in the environment that would lead to advantage or threat mitigation. 

Hagens claims that our modern market allocation scheme is but the natural result of "an intelligent species finding an abundance of resources." Our consumptive economic activities provide us with desired cognitive states, both through novelty reward pathways and social status reward pathways. A distinction is made between things that "feel good" for the individual (chemically), and those that actually "are good" for the individual.

This distinction between an enjoyable experience vs. a "true good" for the individual is also captured in the discussion on human need. Hedonic approaches to human need focus on providing humans with enjoyable experiences and desired mental states. Eudamaic approaches focus more on the human achieving full potential and living "the good life" without a certain requirement for pleasurable states.

One significant issue with the hedonic approach to human need is that of [[adaptive preference]] or riding the [[Hedonic Treadmill]] or [[Consumptive Tolerance]]. Consumptive tolerance is where we get so used to high levels of consumption, of activities that help us reach these desired cognitive states, that we require more and more consumption in order to reach the same desired states. This leads to us being stuck on the [[Hedonic Treadmill]], consuming more in order to reach the same desired state. 

The feedback loops present in optimizing cognitive states has led to some scholars calling for a [[eudaimonic approach]] to understanding human need with respect to environmental limits ([[@brand-correaFrameworkDecouplingHuman2017]]).
