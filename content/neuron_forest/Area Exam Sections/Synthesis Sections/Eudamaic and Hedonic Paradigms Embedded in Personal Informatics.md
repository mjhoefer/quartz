The dichotomy between eudamaic and hedonic ([[hedonic psychology]]) approaches to well-being, and understanding the human experience, implicitly exists within the design of personal informatics systems. Eudaimonic approaches focus on purpose and meaning, while hedonic approach focus on pleasure and enjoyment in the moment.  From my understanding of existing paradigms, most PI platforms focus on data collection of in-the-moment experiences, which aligns with that of hedonic psychology. Systems that capture emotions, mood, heart rate, etc., all align with hedonic psychology. 

However, the [[Integration (PI Stage)]] of this hedonic-focused data can allow for higher level thinking about the self in the [[eudaimonic approach]] paradigm. For example, a single run tracked by Strava would capture elements of the lived-experience of the run. However, looking at progress of the pace and distance over time could help contribute to individuals understanding and guiding behavior to becoming their ideal self. Peronsonal informatics systems therefore can serve as a way of translating hedonic experiences into eudamaic understanding and growth through integration of hedonic experiences across time.

While [[Personal Informatics]] systems can indeed integrate hedonic experience data to provide meaningful (eudaimonic) interactions, there is a subset of eudaimonic aspects of life that cannot be derived from pure hedonic, experiential data. I suggest this is a significant gap in the personal informatics literature - *the design of systems that are explicitly meant to support high level meaning making of an individual becoming their ideal self*.  

One likely cause of this gap is due to available data. Most personal informatics systems are revolved around objective data that can be captured, often with sensors rather than relying on user input.
