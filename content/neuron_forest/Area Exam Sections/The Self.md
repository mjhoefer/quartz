The self is sort of a way of thinking about an individual's notion of who it is.

A seminal work on the concept of the self comes from the [[Reading List on the Self]], 	is [[@jamesConsciousnessSelf1890]], which depicts a view of self at three levels of analysis.

## Constituents of the Self

The first level is **the constituents of the self**, working under the view that the self is comprised of a series of smaller parts.  This basic understanding, that the self has parts, has been recently revived as the "Multiple Self-Aspects Framework" (MFA) in [[@mcconnellMultipleSelfAspectsFramework2011]].  In McConnell's MFA, the self is comprised of multiple "self-aspects," which are a general way of categorizing meaningful contexts one finds oneself in. In McConnell's paper, a collection of self-aspects representing a fictional character Rachael is presented, and include aspects related to roles (student), social identities (Jewish), and relationships (Mike's girlfriend). McConnell claims that self-aspects can also be associated with goals, affective states, and specific behavioral situations.

While the self-aspect construct is broad and highly idiosyncratic, it does provide a lens with which to understand a possible structure of the self. Namely, as seen in the image above, the MFA framework declares a network strucure between self-aspects and "attributes," which are any descriptions of the individual.  According to the MFA, attributes fall into one of the following categories:

* Traits (ie, talkative)
* Behaviors (ie, questioning)
* Physical Characteristics (ie, tall)
* Affect (ie, moody)
* Social categories (ie, female)

The distinction between attributes and self-aspects is largely the relation to the self they refer to. Attributes are "descriptive information about the individual" whereas self-aspects represent the "context binding that individuating information together." The distinction between these constructs is vague (admitted by McConnell), but operational given the empirical evidence that individuals are able to elicit distinct self-aspects and attributes. 

Regardless of the specific construct of "self-aspect" and "attribute," the MFA theory provides a key insight in stating the self can be structured in a network form. In the particular example above (Rachael), a [[bipartite network]] is formed between self-aspects and attributes. As any attribute can be associated with one or more self-aspects (and vice versa), the network is an appropriate representation of this many-to-many relationship. 

The idea of structuring the self in a network form can be used for other constructs besides self-aspects and attributes. Traditionally, [[Network Science]] has worked under a paradigm of "individual as node."  Social network analysis largely operates on the assumption that an individual is best represented as a single node connected to other nodes. While some network methods have been used for describing phenomena *internal* to an individual, such as brain networks, it seems that there is a significant gap between modern psychological understanding of the self, and how the self is represented in most computing systems.

Perhaps the closest approach to a network representation of an individual comes from the area of *ego networks*, which are intended to represent an individual and their own "ego centric" network [[@crossleySocialNetworkAnalysis2015]]. In other words - an ego net is a network consisting of the individual and those connected to the individual. Multilayer ego nets can highlight an individual's role in multiple contexts, However, to my knowledge there is no ego net methodology that treats the individual as consisting of more than one node. 

## Self-Feelings

The second level of analysis suggested by [[@jamesConsciousnessSelf1890]] is the emotion and affective experience of "having" a particular self ("self-feelings"). In this level, there is a significant tie to self-evaluation, and the idea that the way one perceives oneself will have a causal effect on one's momentary affective state. The MFA model also emphasizes the role of self as a determinant of affect. The MFA model suggests that affect is derived from self-evaluations in particular contexts (self-aspects), and these evaluations take place through attribute evaluation. For example, if an attribute of "intelligence" is associated with a "student" self-aspect, then an individual's affective state when the student aspect is activated may partially rely on that individual's evaluation of how intelligent they think themself to be. 

## Self-Seeking and Self-Preservation
The last level of analysis proposed by James is that of behavior driven by a drive to "seek" the self or preserve the self.
