In this section I will discuss relevant HCI methodologies for collecting data about individuals, for use in both psychological research and personal informatics contexts. The main methodologies reviewed are:

* Think-Aloud Method
* Experience Sampling Method (ESM)
* Day Reconstruction Method (DRM)


Think Aloud Method
======
The think aloud method was pioneer for use in evaluating interactive systems by Clayton Lewis in [[@lewisUsingThinkingAloudMethod1982]]. In this study, Lewis described the approach used by IBM to assess cognitive processes that occur when an individual is using an interface. The primary goal in the IBM report is to better understand problems users face when trying to use the software. 

The think-aloud method is relatively simple - simply documenting what the user is doing with the system, alongside their thoughts. The role of the researcher is to stay as hands-off as possible. The only recommended prompt is to encourage the participant to keep speaking their thoughts out loud ("keep a running commentary").

Think Aloud Limitations
=====

The limitations of this method include the intrusion of the requirement to speak aloud the thoughts. Most systems are not intended to be used while the user is voicing thoughts, so this may change the way in which the individual interacts with the system. The hypothesis is that the direction to speak thoughts may increase focus of the user, and therefore result in more positive outcomes than might be expected from in-situ use. In addition, the speaking requirement may also throw off performance metrics like completion time (necessitating a separate study).

Another limitation stated is that the method is time consuming - a researcher must be present with the participant throughout the duration of the study.  [[Future Work]] might include exploring a think-aloud method done remotely over Zoom, using automated prompts to provoke thought elicitation, and screensharing being recorded in the meeting. The researcher could then watch the thinking aloud at an accelerated speed to reduce the time burden.
