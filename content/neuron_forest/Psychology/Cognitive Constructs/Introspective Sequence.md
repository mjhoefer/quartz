A sequence of processes described by [[natsoulas_concerning_1970]] with the following components:

1. The [[Mental Episodes]] itself (about which some [[Introspective knowledge]] is acquired) (this is supposedly involving [[Immediate Existence]])
2. The process of [[Introspection]] itself, resulting in introspective awareness
3. Introspective awareness itself - the actual resulting knowledge structure about some sort of mental episode. "The taking of the mental episode to have this or that set of characteristics and identities" [[natsoulas_concerning_1970]]. Proposed to be a propositional structure in [[pylyshyn_what_1973]], as opposed to purely image or sensory based.
