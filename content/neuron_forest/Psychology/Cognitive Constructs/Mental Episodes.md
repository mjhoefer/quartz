Mental events, states and processes are all referred to as "mental episodes" by Natsoulas in [[natsoulas_concerning_1970]].

Three interests in mental episodes are :

1. Methodological: how to determine truth of espoused mental episodes
2. Substantive: what are mental episodes made up of
3. Cognitive: what awareness does an individual have of their own mental episodes
