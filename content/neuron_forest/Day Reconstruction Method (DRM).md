Described in [[@kahnemanSurveyMethodCharacterizing2004]]. 

Combines [[Experience Sampling Method]] with [[Time Budgets]] in order to understand people's lived experiences. Also similar to [[Ecological Momentary Assessment]]

The stated purposes for the DRM include:

The [[Experience Sampling Method]] has limitations of being time consuming, and often does not capture rare events. As such, the DRM focuses on capturing time-use, and retrospectively reporting on affect associated with time-use. 

The process of DRM is as follows:

1. Individuals create a diary record of the day ("sequence of episodes")
2. Answering questions about each episode (what was the situation, how did they feel). 


DRM is meant to be an approximation of results that would be obtained by [[Experience Sampling Method]].  By only reflecting on the previous day, biases are limited.

One limitation of [[retrospective report]] is that individuals tend to draw from [[prototypical experiences]] rather than typical experiences, and so by reflecting on specific episodes, this prototype bias is expected to be limited in DRM. 

Evidence for the success of the DRM is that the reported tiredness levels throughout the day tend to follow the [[diurnal pattern]] elicited in [[Experience Sampling Method]] studies.

DRM can shed light on the [[Hedonic Treadmill]], as changes in life situation do not necessarily result in increased satisfaction on a day-to-day lived experience basis. 


This is a method for [[Measuring Well-Being]]
