An external representation (ER), as defined by [[@coxRepresentationConstructionExternalised1999]], is a model of a system that is outside of the brain. 

Cox describes the duality between the internal representation, the [[Mental Models]] inside the mind, and how it both informs and is informed by the ER on the paper/screen/physicalization/etc. Cox makes a distinction between an ER that is self-constructed, and an ER that is provided to the thinker. 

ERs can be used both individually and socially. In a social context, an ER is a place where shared meaning can be made and communicated.
