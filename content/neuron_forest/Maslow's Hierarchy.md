A theory of [[Human Need]].

While Maslow did not claim to know the set of basic needs, his theory was largely that some needs come before others. IE, if I am hungry, I will seek food more than I will seek social belonging.  

The pyramid has been shown to be a general guidline, as opposed to a rule. Suicide bombers do not fit in with the pyramid.
