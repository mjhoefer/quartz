This idea from [[natsoulas_concerning_1970]] is that we have varying degrees of confidence in our own mental episodes. 

"Certain
categories of belief, denned perhaps in
terms of how they are reached or their kind
of contents (e.g., with apparent immediacy,
on a sensory basis, with qualitative content),
may be particularly prone to being accompanied
by feelings of certainty."
