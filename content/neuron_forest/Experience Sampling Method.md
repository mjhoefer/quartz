A method for capturing in-the-moment experiences, with a goal of limiting the amount of time and cognitive delay between the experience of the phenomena to be captured, and the capturing of that phenomena. 

[[Daniel Kahneman]] is of the view that experience sampling provides a way to capture [[objective happiness]], as [[retrospective report]] is subject to a wide variety of biases (in [[@kahneman1999well]]). 

Experience sampling has been studied in [[@csikszentmihalyiValidityReliabilityExperienceSampling2014]]. According to this paper, the ESM can be used to collect three types of information:

1. Objective facts about activities, behavior, contexts, etc. We can literally learn what people are doing by asking them in the moment.  This is effectively tracking [[activities of daily living (ADL)]]. 
2. Psychological states - emotions, felt experiences. This is aligned with the [[lived experience]] of doing certain things. We can learn how people feel by asking them what they feel in the moment.
3. Thoughts - higher level conscious cognitive thoughts, not necessarily tied to emotions. We can learn what people think by asking them what they think in the present moment. 


[[@csikszentmihalyiValidityReliabilityExperienceSampling2014]] describes the goal of ESM as "sample experience systematically." 


ESM arose from [[Time Budgets]] and pyschological responses to certain experiences/activities.
