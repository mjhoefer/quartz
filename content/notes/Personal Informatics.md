Models of Personal Informatics
====

Personal informatics (PI) is the study of personal data collection and sensemaking at the individual level. Personal informatics systems are those designed to facilitate an individual collecting data about their lives, and often include interfaces for interacting with collected data. The specific study of the visualizations of personal data is known as [[personal visual analytics]] and resides under the umbrella of [[Information Visualization]]. While the ultimate goal of personal informatics is not always clearly stated, the general trend is for a system to collect data about one's life for the purposes of later reflecting on that data.

The stage based model developed in [[@liStagebasedModelPersonal2010]], along with the lived-informatics model developed in [[@epsteinLivedInformaticsModel2015]], are the two main highly cited papers used to describe the general paradigm of many current personal informatics projects. Despite their named difference, both consist of a series of stages that an individual moves through. The stage-based model has the following stages:

The first stage, [[Preparation (PI Stage)]], is when an individual starts to get ready to collect data about themself. They may discover tracking tools of interest, or have some internal motivation for behavior change, or simply curiousity. 

The second stage, [[Collection (PI Stage)]], is the actual use of the personal informatics system and collection of data about the self. A digital or paper record is created, and data about one's life is persisted into the future. Note that the data collected may be objective (such as the number of miles ran) or subjective (such as a self-reported mood).

The third stage, [[Integration (PI Stage)]], is the process of transforming the collected data into something useful for review and reflection. This process results in some [[External Representations]] of the self, either manually created by the individual or automatically constructed by the PI system. 

The fouth stage, [[Reflection (PI Stage)]], is the poorly defined process of looking at the integrated data. Li does not describe specifically what happens, but implies that some change occurs in the individual's mind, which facilitates the next stage. 

The last stage of Li's model, [[Action (PI Stage)]], is when the individual chooses to do something differently based on the reflection in the prior stage. This can either be system driven (for example, Apple's screentime automatically shutting off access to certain apps after a certain amount of screentime), or user-driven (a user choosing to not take their phone to dinner after seeing the screentime report). 

Limitations of Li's Model
==

Unfortunately, Li's model fails to include the important (and well-documented) informatics phenomena known as *reactivity.* [[Reactivity]] is when the act of [[Collection (PI Stage)]] itself results in behavioral changes, and generally in the desired direction. In other words, tracking something you want to change results in change, even without reflecting on an integrated data visualization. 

Another limitation of Li's model is the separation of collection and reflection. The collection stage is described as being relatively simple - collect data about your life. The stage implies that data collection is nothing more than creating a [[digital twin]] of activities or states that have one clear objective source of truth in the "real world." I suggest this is a significant limitation in the conceptualization of PI systems -- the focus on reflection *on* data, as opposed to reflection *for* data.

Application Areas of Personal Informatics
====

There are many different kinds of data that have been collected using both informal and formal personal informatics systems. Generally, formal personal informatics systems are those that are designed for a specific purpose (IE, using [[Mint]] to track spending. Informal personal informatics systems are those that individuals build for a particular purpose of goal, or co-opt a tool from another general purpose tool such as excel.

The closest study of financial transactions within the scope of HCI comes from [[@kayeMoneyTalksTracking2014]]. They basically explored how people track personal finance in different contexts.  They found that there are many complex motivational factors for completing a financial transaction, including "emotional, historical, familial, and personal backgrounds." They specifically noted the "enourmous number of factors our interviewees are juggling when they make financial decisions." This suggests individuals may have a challenge assigning financial transactions to needs - it may be difficult to take a transaction that occured due to complex emotional and historical reasons and assign it as fulfilling some need.
